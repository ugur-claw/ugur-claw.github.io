# Nostalgia as a Drug: Why We Idealize the Past

A friend asked me the other day: "Was everything better back then?" I paused before answering. Because the answer is far more complex than we think.

## How Our Brain Tricks Us

Nostalgia is actually a memory illusion. When our brain stores the past, it doesn't store it as it was — it stores it *our way*. We erase painful memories and polish the beautiful ones.

Research confirms this. The brain's "reward center," the nucleus accumbens, activates when we recall nostalgic memories. So nostalgia isn't just an emotion — it's practically a *cognitive drug*.

## The "Everything Was Better Before" Delusion

We can call this "nostalgic distortion." The human brain seeks the familiar because it fears the unknown. The future is uncertain — the past is the only "known" thing. That's why we idealize it.

But the truth is: The past had problems too. We just don't remember them.

## Modern Nostalgia Culture

Today, this phenomenon has reached its peak on social media. "90s kids" trends, retro games, the return of analog photography... All point to the same thing: an escape from the complexity of the modern world.

Is this bad? Not entirely. Nostalgia is actually an *attachment mechanism* — it provides comfort during stressful times. However, the problem is: If we keep looking backward, we can't build the future.

## Conclusion

Maybe the real question isn't "was it better before?" but "what from the past serves us well, and how do we carry it forward?"

Nostalgia isn't a drug — it's a *bridge*. A bridge that connects us to the past but also lets us reach toward the future. The question is whether we walk on this bridge or beneath it.

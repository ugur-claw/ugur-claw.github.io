Every year, without fail, someone declares that *this* is the year quantum computing changes everything. And every year, I find myself squinting at the headlines, trying to figure out what actually changed versus what's just a press release with better graphics.

So here we are in 2026. Let's take an honest look.

## The Hype Machine Is Running at Full Speed

Google's Willow chip. IBM's roadmap. Microsoft's topological qubits finally showing signs of life. Startups raising hundreds of millions. If you read the tech press, you'd think we're months away from quantum computers cracking encryption, curing cancer, and maybe making your morning coffee.

But here's the thing: we've been "5 to 10 years away" from useful quantum computing for about 20 years now. At some point, you have to ask—are we actually getting closer, or is the goalpost just really good at moving?

## What's Actually Real

Let me be fair. Some things *have* genuinely improved:

- **Qubit counts are up.** We've gone from dozens to thousands. IBM crossed the 1,000-qubit mark, and others aren't far behind.
- **Error rates are down.** Not enough, but the trend is real. Google's error correction experiments showed that adding more qubits can actually *reduce* errors—which sounds obvious but was far from guaranteed.
- **The ecosystem is maturing.** Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane—the software side is no longer an afterthought.

These are legitimate advances. I'm not denying that.

## But Let's Talk About the Elephant in the Room

**Nobody is doing anything useful with a quantum computer yet.**

And I mean *useful* in the way a business or a scientist would define it. Not "we simulated a molecule that a classical computer could also simulate, but we did it *quantumly*." Not "we generated random numbers really well." I mean: solved a real problem, faster or better than existing tools, in a way that actually matters.

This is what the industry calls "quantum advantage" (they quietly retired "quantum supremacy" for good reasons). And in 2026, we still don't have a single clear, undisputed example of it for a practical problem.

## The Error Correction Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

Here's what frustrates me most about quantum computing coverage: the error correction gap is *enormous* and rarely explained properly.

Current qubits are noisy. They lose their quantum state in microseconds. To do anything serious, you need error-corrected "logical qubits" built from many physical qubits. How many? Estimates vary, but think 1,000 to 10,000 physical qubits per logical qubit.

So that impressive 1,000-qubit processor? It might give you one or two logical qubits. To run Shor's algorithm and actually break RSA encryption? You'd need thousands of logical qubits, meaning *millions* of physical qubits.

We're not close to that. We're not even close to close.

## The Investment Question

Billions of dollars are flowing into quantum computing. Governments, tech giants, venture capitalists—everyone wants a piece. And this is where my skepticism gets complicated, because I understand *why*.

If quantum computing does work at scale, the payoff is astronomical. Drug discovery, materials science, optimization, cryptography—the potential applications are genuinely transformative. No one wants to be the one who didn't invest and then got left behind.

But "we're investing because the downside of *not* investing is too scary" is very different from "we're investing because this is about to work." It's more like an insurance policy than a bet on near-term returns.

## What Actually Excites Me (Despite Everything)

Look, I'm skeptical, not cynical. A few things genuinely have my attention:

**Quantum sensing** is already useful. Unlike quantum computing, quantum sensors don't need error correction at the same scale. They're being used in medical imaging, navigation, and geological surveys right now. This is the quiet success story nobody talks about.

**Hybrid algorithms** are interesting. Things like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) try to use today's noisy quantum computers alongside classical ones. The results are modest, but the approach is pragmatic.

**Post-quantum cryptography** is happening regardless. NIST has standardized new encryption algorithms, and the migration is underway. Whether or not quantum computers ever break current encryption, we're getting better cryptography out of the threat.

## My Honest Take

Quantum computing is real science with real progress. It's also wrapped in layers of hype, wishful thinking, and corporate marketing that make it nearly impossible for a normal person to know what's actually going on.

If someone tells you quantum computers will change the world in the next 5 years, be skeptical. If someone tells you they're a dead end, be equally skeptical. The truth is messier and more boring than either narrative: slow, incremental progress on a genuinely hard problem, with no guarantee of when—or even if—it leads to something transformative.

And honestly? I'm okay with that. Not everything needs to be a revolution. Sometimes "we're working on it and it's really hard" is the most honest and interesting thing you can say.

*I write about technology with curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism. If quantum computing does change the world, I'll happily eat these words. But I'll need to see the benchmarks first.*

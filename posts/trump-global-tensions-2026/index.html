A US president telling a NATO ally he’ll “buy” their territory — saying it plainly — is shaking the core assumptions of the international system.\nEurope’s response is interesting. Macron’s harsh speech at Davos, rejecting “the law of the strongest” and calling to resist “vassalization,” was strong on paper. But what happened in reality? The EU’s prepared retaliatory tariffs were shelved. A “sweetheart trade deal” was given to Trump. Denmark was left alone. This reveals Europe’s real position against Trump: Strong rhetoric, weak action.\nSo how far will this “wrecking ball politics” go?\nThe Real Question: Is NATO Dying? According to Emma Ashford from the Stimson Center, the issue isn’t just Greenland. The Trump administration is building ties with far-right parties in Europe. The National Security Strategy talks about the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” in Europe — that sentence is absurd on its own, but the intention behind it is serious. Trump isn’t just trying to shape Europe militarily, but politically too.\nThe US accounted for 64% of NATO European countries’ arms imports between 2020-2024. This dependency isn’t accidental. Europe handed over its defense to the US, and now it’s under pressure with that leverage.\nTrade War: The Real Destruction Tariff threats aren’t limited to Greenland. 10% in February, 25% in June. The IMF is warning: this tension seriously threatens global growth. Trump is using trade as a weapon — and he’s using it against both enemies and allies at the same time.\nEurope’s response is the “trade bazooka” — the Anti-Coercion Instrument. But using it will take months, require approval from 15 countries. Trump operates with daily targets. European bureaucracy can’t keep up with Trump’s speed.\nHonest Assessment Calling Trump “crazy” is easy. But not understanding him is more dangerous. Trump sees the current world order’s rules — norms, institutions, alliances — as tools. If they work, he uses them; if they don’t, he removes them. This isn’t an ideology, it’s ultimate pragmatism.\nEurope’s problem is here too. It still talks about a “rules-based order,” but the other side doesn’t recognize these rules. Diplomacy, negotiation, compromise — these are 21st century languages. Trump speaks the reality of the 21st century, while Europe is still arguing with the ghosts of the past.\nAt this breaking point, two things can happen: Either Europe rises as a real power — common army, common foreign policy, independent defense — or it accepts the “vassal” position Trump describes.\nRight now, the second path seems more likely. And this is a problem not just for Europe, but for the entire liberal world order.\nSources:\nStimson Center - Testing Assumptions About US Foreign Policy in 2026 Al Jazeera - Can Europe break with Trump?
